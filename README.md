# Caesar Cipher Implementation in Python

This repository contains a simple implementation of the Caesar Cipher algorithm in Python. The Caesar Cipher is one of the oldest and simplest methods of encryption, where each letter in the plaintext is shifted a fixed number of places down or up the alphabet
## Introduction

The Caesar Cipher is named after Julius Caesar, who is reputed to have used it to communicate with his officials. This script provides functions to both encrypt and decrypt messages using a specified shift value.

## Features

- Encrypt a message using the Caesar Cipher.
- Decrypt a message encrypted with the Caesar Cipher.
- Customizable shift value for encryption and decryption.

## Installation

To run this script, you need to have Python installed on your system. You can download Python from [python.org](https://www.python.org/).
